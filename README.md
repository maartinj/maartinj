MedScan is an iOS app for identifying medications. Take a photo of a medication's packaging, and the image recognition system suggests the medication. After scanning, it displays detailed information about the medication - name, dosage and potential side effects. It helps you quickly check basic information about the pills you find, increasing safety and confidence when taking the medication.
